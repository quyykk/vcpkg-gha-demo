## vcpkg binary caching on the Github Actions cache!

This is a sample repo demonstrating vcpkg using the GHA cache. You can look over the commit CI logs to see it in action, as well as the [Cache list](https://github.com/quyykk/vcpkg-gha-demo/actions/caches) to see the caches saved.

You need vcpkg version 2023-03-22 or higher.
